Introduction
Understanding customer behavior is crucial for businesses to tailor their marketing efforts effectively. This project aims to analyze customer data to identify distinct segments, which allows for targeted and personalized marketing strategies. By analyzing customer attributes and behaviors, we can uncover patterns that help us create strategies that resonate with each segment's preferences.

Objectives
Customer Segmentation: Use clustering techniques to identify different customer segments based on attributes like purchase behavior, product preferences, and engagement levels.

Personalized Marketing: Develop tailored marketing strategies for each customer segment to maximize engagement and revenue.

Data-Driven Decisions: Leverage data analysis to drive informed decisions about marketing campaigns and customer engagement efforts

The project uses customer transaction data, including attributes such as transaction dates, product categories, total order amounts, gender, location, tenure months, and recency. The data helps identify customer behavior patterns and preferences.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the raw data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data distribution, identifying trends, and exploring relationships between attributes.
Clustering: Using clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to segment customers based on their attributes and behaviors.
Segment Analysis: Examining the characteristics of each segment to uncover distinct behaviors and preferences.
Strategy Development: Creating personalized marketing strategies for each segment based on their preferences and behavior patterns.
